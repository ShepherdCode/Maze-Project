<h1>Maze-Project</h1>
This program can generate Mazes using Wilson's algorithm.

It can also create Mazes with a bias towards longer passages

The Mazes generated are tested to have the following properties:
* Complete - Every point in the maze must be reachable by another
* Reachable - Every point in the maze can be reached by all other points


This was implemented using JGraphT (http://jgrapht.org/) and a custom built maze generator
